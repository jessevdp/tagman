## About

TagMan is a two-dimensional single-player game build in Java for a school assignment. The rules of the game and programming language were part of what was assigned. School provided a basic wireframe for the UI and the graphics for the player.

## Features

The current version of the game (v1.2.0) includes the following features on top of the requirements for the basic version:

- Animated player
- Sound effects
- 4 levels (2 extra)

## Usage

The simplest way to get up and running with the game is to [download the latest `.jar` file here](https://github.com/jessevdp/tagman/releases) and run it. If you don't know how to run a `.jar` file use these guides for [Windows](https://windowsreport.com/jar-file-windows/#2) and [macOS](https://www.wikihow.com/Run-a-.Jar-Java-File#On-Mac_sub). Make sure that you have Java installed, else [download Java here](https://www.java.com/download/).
